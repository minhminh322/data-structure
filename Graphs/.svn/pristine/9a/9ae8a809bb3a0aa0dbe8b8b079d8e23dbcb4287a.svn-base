TCSS 342 - Data Structures

Assignment 5 Part 2

Modify this file to add answers to the questions below.


Most questions below refer to the Graph.pdf file included with the starter code for this assignment.
Graph.pdf shows the same graph used in part 1 of this assignment.
That graph is referred to as G in this document.

For questions 1 to 6 below answer TRUE or FALSE.

Q1.  Graph G is a digraph.

Q2.  Graph G is acyclic.

Q3.  Graph G is a weighted graph.

Q4.  Graph G is a complete graph.

Q5.  In graph G, vertex 1 (Aberdeen) is reachable from vertex 4 (Kennewick).

Q6.  Graph G is a connected graph.


For questions 7 to 10 below provide short answers.

Q7.  What is the cardinality of the vertex set (|V|) in graph G?

Q8.  List the vertices that are adjacent to vertex 9 (Tacoma) in graph G.

Q9.  What is the in-degree of vertex 8 (Spokane) in graph G?

Q10. What is the cost of the simple path {7, 6, 1} in graph G?


Questions 11 - 14 refer to DFS and BFS

Q11. Show the order in which vertices would be visited by a depth first search (DFS) starting at node 7 (Seattle).
You may show either the node numbers or the city names.

Q12. Which previously studied data structure is used in the implementation of DFS? 

Q13. Show the order in which vertices would be visited by a breadth first search (BFS) starting at node 7 (Seattle).
You may show either the node numbers or the city names.

Q14. Which previously studied data structure is used in the implementation of BFS?


Question 15 and 16 below refer to the starter code provide with this assignment.

Q15. In your own words, briefly describe the purpose of the minimalPath() method in class WeightedAdjMatrixGraph.

Q16. In your own words, briefly describe the purpose of the floydShortestPaths() method in class WeightedAdjMatrixGraph.

For questions 17 through 20, match the name of the algorithm to the problem in graph theory it is designed to solve (from the A to F list below).
You may need to do a bit of research on the Internet to answer these questions. NOTE: below the list of questions is a list of various problems.

Q17. Dijkstra's algorithm.

Q18. Prim's algorithm.

Q19. Kruskal's algorithm

Q20. The Floyd-Warshall algorithm


Problems in graph theory:
A) Minimum spanning tree
B) Single-source shortest paths (graph without negative edge weights)
C) Single-source shortest paths (graph may include negative edge weights)
D) Maximum flow in a flow network
E) All pairs shortest paths
F) Topological sort
